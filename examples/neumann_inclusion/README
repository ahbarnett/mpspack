This directory contains codes for Neumann inclusion bounds used in the
paper arxiv:1512.04165 (codename "ninc"), "Comparable upper and lower
bounds for boundary values of Neumann eigenfunctions and tight
inclusion of eigenvalues", by A H Barnett, A Hassell, and M Tacy.

Barnett 4/13/16

This uses MFS (exterior point sources) and plain recursive search in k
(not a scaling-type method) for high-accuracy Neumann eigenvalues and
their bounds, for a smooth domain. The tightness of the bounds is the
main point, not the efficiency of locating candidate eigenvalues.

Codes:

tbl_mfsgsvdincl.m : make sweep data, min sing val search, inclusion
                    bnd data for Table 1, and mode of Figure 3.
                    This is the main driver script.
fig_Gh.m : make Figure 1(c-d) showing filter function.
fig_intromodes.m : compute modes and make Figure 1(a-b).
fig_tsweeps.m : make Figure 2 using data from swp=1 in tbl_mfsgsvdincl.m
genrefsetneu.m : use Fred det method to make reference sets of Neumann EVs.
test_gsvd.m : checking MATLAB's GSVD definition, not same as Golub & van Loan.
Cennenbach.m : estimate constant C in prior literature (Ennenbach '95)

Also needed for this work, codes which I decided to bring in as @evp/ methods
(since they are helpers for EVPs, even though they don't act on an evp object):

../../@evp/spectralfiltermatrix.m
../../@evp/gsvdtension.m
../../@evp/intnormmatrix.m
../../@utils/lowestn.m
