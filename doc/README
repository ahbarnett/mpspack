Docs for MPSpack

The tex files here can be compiled but require EPS figures in the figs/
directory. Some of these can be created by running examples/*.m codes.
However, since the full set of EPS files is over 60 MB, I have not
included them in this repo. Thus if you chose to try latex compilation
you would get a ton of errors and a figure-free manual and tutorial.
