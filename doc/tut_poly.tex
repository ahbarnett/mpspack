\section{Polygons, corners, and corner-adapted bases}
\label{s:poly}

So far each disconnected boundary piece of the domain
has been a single segment connected to itself head-to-tail.
More generally, a {\em list} of segments may be used to create 
these closed boundary pieces, as long as the last in the list
connects back to the starting point of the first.
For instance, a triangle is built by sending a list of
three line segments to the domain command;
such a list can simply be built from a list of vertices as follows,
\begin{verbatim}
   s = segment.polyseglist([], [1 exp(3i*pi/8) exp(5i*pi/4)]);
   tri = domain(s, 1);
\end{verbatim}
Since {\tt s} is a 1-by-3 array of (handles to) segments,
the 2nd argument of the domain constructor
is automatically vectorized to {\tt [1 1 1]}.
Each of the segments could have been made separately, e.g.\ the first by
{\tt s(1) = segment([], [1 exp(3i*pi/8)]);} etc.
Fig.~\ref{f:doms}b shows {\tt tri.plot} output for this domain.%
  \footnote{Notice that periodic quadrature would now be inappropriate:
    in fact $M=20$ point Clenshaw-Curtis is used by default for open
    segments}

Let's discuss corners: their angles are indicated by the solid black
`fans' in the plot (before now these have had angle $\pi$, hence semicircles).
A black fan at the junction of two segments indicates that a corner
linkage was made (warnings will be given if any segment ends are left
dangling), and shows the angle range pointing {\em into} the domain.
%The data is stored in the domain properties as {\tt tri.
%and their start and end angles

Segment lists may also be sent to the excluded-region arguments of the
domain constructor, for instance to create the domain exterior
to the triangle,
\co{exttri = domain([], [], s(end:-1:1), -1);}
where it was important to reverse the order of the segment list
so that they connect head-to-tail correctly.
To create the domain exterior to two nearby triangles,
\begin{verbatim}
   ss = s.translate(2);
   exttwotri = domain([], [], {s(end:-1:1), ss(end:-1:1)}, {-1, -1});
\end{verbatim}
We remind the reader that to create the above domains
using the existing segment array {\tt s}, each time a {\tt s.disconnect}
would be needed beforehand (this acts on all segments in the list).%
  \footnote{Also note that the domains previously linked to the segments, such
    as {\tt tri}, would be left `dangling' since {\tt s} no longer is linked
    back to them. Attempts to use {\tt tri} in a BVP would now be doomed
    unless the data {\tt s(:).dom} were manually rewritten to point to
    the domain (see manual). When in doubt, disconnect segments then remake
    all domains.}
A universal rule is:
\begin{center}\framebox{\mbox{Each side of a segment may be associated with
at most one domain}}\end{center}

\ca{a) Comparing convergence of boundary error norm for Fourier Bessel
vs corner-adapted fractional-order Fourier Bessel basis sets
in a triangle with unity Dirichlet boundary data, for Helmholtz
BVP with $k=10$, on log-log axes. b) The solution function.}{f:triconv}
\efi

Say we want to solve an interior Helmholtz BVP on the original triangle
of this section, and {\tt s} and {\tt tri} have been set up as with the
first two commands of this section but with $M=50$ quadrature points.
Say we want constant boundary data 1.
We may use a Fourier-Bessel basis set, solve, and
plot error convergence with a simple code,
\begin{verbatim}
   s.setbc(-1, 'D', [], @(t) ones(size(t)));   % note inline "1 function"
   tri.addregfbbasis(0, []); tri.bas{1}.rescale_rad = 1.0; % for stability
   p = bvp(tri);
   tri.k = 10;                               % set wavenumber
   Ns = 2:2:40; for i=1:numel(Ns)
     p.updateN(Ns(i)); p.solvecoeffs; r(i) = p.bcresidualnorm;
   end
   figure; loglog(2*Ns, r, '+-'); xlabel('# dofs'); ylabel('bdry err norm');
\end{verbatim}
This produces the algebraic convergence
shown in blue in Fig.~\ref{f:triconv}a.
Why is this so slow? The triangle has three {\em singular} corners
(i.e.\ one whose angle is not $\pi$ divided by an integer), and
generically the exact solution to
such a problem has a singularity at each such corner.%
  \footnote{The power law for convergence is related to the corner
    angles and is discussed in \cite{Ei74}.}

We now show how corner-adapted basis sets
achieve superior convergence and hence
more efficiency. We clear the previous basis set from the domain
then add fractional-order (i.e. `wedge' expansion) Fourier-Bessel bases
at each corner, of both cos and sin type.%
  \footnote{Sometimes an expansion is needed at some corners and not
    others. E.g.\ expansions at only the first two corners can be
    set up by passing in the options {\tt opts.cornermultipliers = [1 1 0];}.}
Repeating the convergence study and comparing against the previous data is easy,
%super-algebraic ?
\begin{verbatim}
tri.clearbases;
opts.rescale_rad = 2.0; tri.addcornerbases([], opts);
r = []; Ns = 1:13; for i=1:numel(Ns)
  p.updateN(Ns(i)); nn(i) = p.N; p.solvecoeffs; r(i) = p.bcresidualnorm;
end
hold on; loglog(nn, r, 'r+-');  % plot error vs total # dofs
\end{verbatim}
The new convergence is shown in red in Fig.~\ref{f:triconv}a,
and is much faster; in fact it appears superalgebraic \cite{timothesis}.
The solution field is Fig.~\ref{f:triconv}b, and its large values
shows that we are quite close to a Dirichlet resonance of the domain.
The basis set geometry in the domain can be visualized by
{\tt tri.showbasesgeom} which shows wedges implied by the corner
expansions.
