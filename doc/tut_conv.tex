\section{Accuracy, convergence, and smooth domains}
\label{s:conv}

How accurate was our numerical solution $u$? One measure is the
$L^2$ error on the boundary, and is estimated by
\co{p.bcresidualnorm}
which returns $2.09 \times 10^{-6}$.
However, since the function $f(z)$ is already harmonic in the domain,
it is in fact the unique solution, and we may plot the
pointwise error in $u$ by passing in the analytic solution as an option,
\co{opts.comparefunc = f; p.showsolution(opts);}
giving Fig.~\ref{f:u}b. Note that the color scale is $10^{-8}$.

In the above, boundary integrals were approximated using the default of
$M=20$ quadrature points, barely adequate given the
oscillatory error function in Fig.~\ref{f:u}b.
$M$ may be easily changed either by specifying
a non-empty first argument in the {\tt segment} constructor above, or
for an existing segment as follows,
\co{s.requadrature(50); p.solvecoeffs; p.bcresidualnorm}
which now gives $1.98\times 10^{-6}$, not much different than before.
Notice that we did not have to redefine the domain {\tt d} nor
the BVP object {\tt p}.

Exploring the convergence of the boundary error norm with the basis set order
needs a simple loop over $N$,
\begin{verbatim}
   for N=1:15
     p.updateN(N); p.solvecoeffs; r(N) = p.bcresidualnorm;
   end
   figure; semilogy(r, '+-'); xlabel('N'); ylabel('bdry err norm');
\end{verbatim}
As the resulting Fig.~\ref{f:conv}a shows, the convergence is exponential.%
  \footnote{Asymptotically, error $\sim e^{-\alpha N}$. In fact the rate is
    $\alpha = \ln \sqrt{13}$, related to the conformal distance to
    the nearest singularity \cite{timothesis}, which here is at $2+3i$.}
Notice we used {\tt updateN} to change the basis set degree
in a problem (in this simple case it is equivalent to 
\verb?d.bas{1}.N = N;?)

Say we want to change the shape of segment {\tt s}, to
a smooth star-shaped `trefoil' domain expressed as by radius $R(\theta) =
1 + 0.3\cos 3\theta$ as a function of angle $0\le \theta< 2\pi$.
This is achieved by passing a 1-by-2
cell array containing the function $R$ and its
derivative $R' = dR/d\theta$ to a variant of the segment constructor,
\begin{verbatim}
s = segment.radialfunc(50, {@(q) 1 + 0.3*cos(3*q), @(q) -0.9*sin(3*q)});
\end{verbatim}
We again chose $M=50$.
The analytic formula for $R'$ is needed to compute normal derivatives
to high accuracy.

One might ask: has this change to {\tt s} {\em propagated}
to the existing domain
object {\tt d} and BVP object {\tt p}, which both refer to it?
In contrast to the case of quadrature point number $M$ above,
the answer is no:
{\tt s} is overwritten by a newly-constructed object, while
{\tt d} and {\tt p} still contain handles pointing to the {\em old}
{\tt s}.
Furthermore, the fact that the segment had domain {\tt d}
attached to its `minus' or back side has been forgotten, as have the
boundary conditions.
(These segment properties are described in the \mpspack\ user manual.)
We must therefore rerun the code from Sec.~\ref{s:lap}
to construct {\tt d} and {\tt p} afresh, before solving.%
  \footnote{Note that in theory it would be possible to
    change one by one each of the segment properties, {\tt t}, {\tt w},
    {\tt speed}, etc, to define the new segment without changing its identity,
    but this is cumbersome. Similarly, searching and changing
    all references to a segment in the properties of {\tt d} and {\tt p}
    is cumbersome. Neither has been implemented by us
    since problem setup time is very rapid.}
The result, plotting the pointwise error as before,
is shown by Fig.~\ref{f:conv}b for $N=8$ and $M=50$.

The {\tt radialfunc} constructor above is limited to radial functions
with quadrature equidistant
in angle. Instead you may create a segment from arbitrary
smooth parametrizations $z(t)$ for $t \in[0,1]$, as long as $z'(t)$
is also given. For instance, a closed crescent-shaped analytic segment is
produced (try it!) by,
\begin{verbatim}
a = 0.2; b = 0.8; w = @(t) exp(2i*pi*t);
s = segment(100, {@(t) w(t)-a./(w(t)+b), ...
                  @(t) 2i*pi*w(t).*(1 + a./(w(t) + b).^2)}, 'p');
\end{verbatim}
Note that a convenient variable $w = e^{2\pi i t}$ was used
via nested anonymous functions.
Heed also the new final argument {\tt 'p'} which enforces
periodic quadrature (the constructor doesn't try to guess your preferred rule).
In order to get high-order (or spectral) convergence, it is recommended
that you choose only smooth (or analytic) $z$.
If periodic quadrature is used,
this also applies to the 1-periodic extension of $z$ to the real line.
If $z(1)\neq z(0)$, the ends of the segment will not connect
up, and the domain constructor above will report an error.
