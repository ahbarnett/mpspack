\section{Solving Laplace's equation in a disc}
\label{s:lap}

We start by setting up a domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
% in which a PDE will be solved.
Domains are built from segments which define their boundary.
To make the unit disc domain,
we first need a circle segment with center
0, radius 1, and angle range
$[0,2\pi)$, as follows,
\co{s = segment([], [0 1 0 2*pi])}
The object {\tt s} is indeed a circular segment, as we may check by
typing {\tt s.plot}, producing Fig.~\ref{f:sd}a.
%or by examining its contents by typing {\tt s}.
All segments have a natural {\em sense}, i.e.\ direction of travel:
for this segment it is counter-clockwise, as shown by the
downwards-pointing
arrow symbol overlayed onto the segment at about 9 o'clock.%
  \footnote{In fact, segments are parametrized internally as function $z(t)$
    of a real variable $t\in[0,1]$, and the sense is the direction of
    increasing $t$. Segment {\tt s} stores this function as {\tt s.Z}.}
Notice also normal vectors (short `hairs') pointing outwards
at each boundary point; our definition is that
normals on a segment always point to the {\em right} when traversing the
sense of the segment.

We create the domain interior to this segment with
\co{d = domain(s, +1)}
where the second argument (here $+1$, the only other option being $-1$)
specifies that the domain is to the `standard' side of the segment, which
we take to be such that the normals point {\em away from} the domain.
That is, with $+1$ the domain lies to the {\em left} of the segment
when traversed in its correct sense (with $-1$ the domain
would lie to the right of the segment.)
Typing {\tt d.plot} produces%
  \footnote{There are extra plotting options and features that
    are described in documentation such as {\tt help domain.plot}.
    E.g.\ in this figure a grid of points interior to the domain has been
    included, achieved with {\tt opts.gridinside=0.05; d.plot(opts);}
    %TODO: demo switch off corner fan.

Fig.~\ref{f:sd}b.
Note that perimeter and area are automatically
labelled (these are only rough approximations intended for sanity checks).

\ca{a) Numerical solution field $u$, b) pointwise error $u-f$,
for Laplace's equation in the unit disc with $M=20$ quadrature points
and 8th-order harmonic polynomials.}{f:u}
\efi

Laplace's equation $\Delta u = 0$ is Helmholtz's equation with wavenumber
zero, which we set for this domain with,
\co{d.k = 0;}
If the problem has many domains the wavenumber should be set globally using the
method {\texttt{problem.setoverallwavenumber}}.
Our philosophy is
to approximate the solution in the domain by a linear combination of
{\em basis functions}, each defined over the whole domain.
%We have to choose how many to use, i.e.\ the
%{\em order} of approximation.
We choose 8th-order harmonic polynomials
$u(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{8} c_n \,\mbox{Re}\,z^n +
\sum_{n=1}^{8} c_{-n}\,\mbox{Im}\,z^n$, where $\mbf{c}:=\{c_n\}_{n=-8}^{8}
\in\mathbb{R}^{17}$
is a coefficient vector, based at the origin 0,
%i.e.\ the sets $\{\mbox{Re } z^n\}_{n=0}^{10}$ and
%$\{\mbox{Im } z^n\}_{n=1}^{10}$,
using the command
\co{d.addregfbbasis(0, 8);}
Let's specify Dirichlet boundary data $f(z) = 
\ln |z-2-3i|$ for
$z$ on the segment%
  \footnote{In other words, $f(x,y) = \ln \sqrt{(x-2)^2+(y-3)^2}$
    for points $(x,y)$ on the boundary.}
by representing this as an anonymous function {\tt f}
and associating it with one side of the segment,
\begin{verbatim}
   f = @(z) log(abs(z-2-3i));
   s.setbc(-1, 'd', [], @(t) f(s.Z(t)));
\end{verbatim}
Note that we needed to pass in a function not of location $z$,
but of the segment parameter $t$;
this was achieved by
wrapping ${\tt f}$ around the parametrization function ${\tt s.Z}$.
The first argument $-1$ expresses that the boundary condition is to be
understood in the limit approaching from the side {\em opposite} the
segment's normal direction, which is where the domain is located.
The second argument {\tt 'd'} specifies that the data is Dirichlet.
 
Finally we use the domain to make a boundary-value
problem object {\tt p},
\co{p = bvp(d);}
and may then solve (in the least-squares sense)
a linear system for the coefficients
\co{p.solvecoeffs;}
If it is needed, {\tt p.co} now contains the coefficients vector $\mbf{c}$.
To evaluate and plot the solution we simply use,
\co{p.showsolution;}
The software chose an appropriate grid covering the domain
(points outside the domain are made transparent, but show
up deep blue in this document), giving Fig.~\ref{f:u}a.
