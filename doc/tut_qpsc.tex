a) Plane wave diffraction from an infinite one-dimensional grating of
transmission (dielectric) obstacles, solved with the {\tt qpscatt} problem class
as in Sec.~\ref{s:qpsc}.
The real part of the full field is shown. The command
{\tt p.showbdry(struct('arrow',0,'normals',0,'label',0,'blobs',0));}
was used
to overlay the boundaries of the central three scatterers plotted as simple
lines.
b) Lattice of Dirichlet obstacles coated with dielectric layer of index 1.5,
with nearby Dirichlet discs
which wrap around the unit cell wall, plotted in the same way.

\mpspack\ includes recently-developed methods to periodize a scattering
problem using layer-potentials on the unit-cell walls \cite{qpsc}.
This means solving for the scattered field due to
a {\em quasi-periodic} incident wave,
such as a plane wave, from an infinite grating (one-dimensional array)
of obstacles.
Here we explain briefly how to set up and solve such problems, by building
on layer-potential methods which solve the scattering problem for
a single obstacle.

We will build on the transmission scattering case of
Sec.~\ref{s:trans}.
We first set up many elements of the single-obstacle scattering problem:
we define a curve with sufficient number of
numerical quadrature points on it to define interior and exterior domains,
add layer-potential bases to them, and set the surface matching conditions,
\begin{verbatim}
s = scale(segment.smoothstar(80, 0.3, 3), 0.35);    % smooth closed curve
de = domain([], [], s, -1);                         % obstacle's exterior
di = domain(s, 1); di.setrefractiveindex(1.5);      % interior, refractive index
s.addinoutlayerpots('d'); s.addinoutlayerpots('s'); % add Rokhlin LP scheme 
s.setmatch('diel', 'TM');                           % TM dielectric continuity
\end{verbatim}
Now comes the periodic ingredients of the problem, in particular the
options parameters defining the Fourier-transform wall layer-potential
representation.
Here we give typical parameters which are good for low-wavenumber problems
($k<30$ for a unit period).
\footnote{{\tt nei} is the number of direct neighbor copies to sum,
{\tt buf} the extra buffer size of the quasi-periodic strip domain,
and {\tt M} half the number of degrees of freedom needed for periodizing.}
These parameters are passed in as options
when setting up the quasi-periodic problem, as follows,
\begin{verbatim}
d = 1.0;                                           % problem period
o.nei = 2; o.buf = 1; o.M = 150;                    % FTy LP method params
p = qpscatt(de, di, d, o);                          % set up the problem
\end{verbatim}
The unit period means that the vertical unit-cell walls will lie at $x=\pm 1/2$.
We may then choose an incident field (which sets the quasi-periodic
Bloch phase, hence determines other method parameters), and solve and plot,
\begin{verbatim}
p.setoverallwavenumber(10);                         % incident wavenumber
p.setincidentwave(-pi/5);                           % incident plane wave angle
p.solvecoeffs;                                      % fill matrices and solve
p.showfullfield(struct('ymax', 1));                 % plot Re part of full field
\end{verbatim}
The call to {\tt p.solvecoeffs} %(matrix fill and linear solve together)
took 0.5 sec, and
computing the field for plotting took another 3.3 sec,
which gives Fig.~\ref{f:qpsc}a.
Three periods of the quasi-periodic full field are shown
(one is computed and the others are phased copies of this one,
so that one may check by eye that the quasi-periodicity condition is
satisfied if the field shown appears smooth).
The option {\tt ymax} controls the upper and lower $y$-axis
limits of the plotting domain; if this omitted, a sensible default is
used which contains the obstacle and a small vertical border.

As with the non-periodic scattering problem, the total field values at points
may now be found, e.g.\ at a single point via
\begin{verbatim}
p.pointsolution(pointset(0.3+0.7i))
\end{verbatim}
This takes 0.06 sec (there is some overhead in handling the
objects in the \matlab\ implementation, which is dominant only when
a small number of points is needed).
Points lying outside the unit cell containing the origin%
  \footnote{Or, when {\tt buf>0}, the contiguous set of
{\tt 1+2*buf} unit cells centered at the origin.}
will not give
correct answers, so in order to evaluate at such points
the user should fold the points back into this cell
and multiply by the appropriate Bloch phase.
It is easy to extract the fractions of incident power that is reflected
into each of the propagating Bragg diffraction grating orders,
\begin{verbatim}
[u d n] = p.braggpowerfracs(struct('table',1));     % intensity of Bragg orders
\end{verbatim}
The sum of the flux fractions should be unity; the error from this is
printed by the above, indicating an error of about $10^{-14}$.
A plot of vectors showing incident and Bragg directions
may also be overlaid on the current field plot with
{\tt p.showbragg}; try it and see!

We conclude with a more complicated example, to show that this is also
easy to set up in \mpspack.
We consider transmission obstacles as above, but now containing a Dirichlet
obstacle inside, and an isolated nearby Dirichlet disc-shaped obstacle.
This is set up from scratch as follows,
\begin{verbatim}
d = 1.0; s = scale(segment.smoothstar(130, 0.3, 3), 0.35);
sm = s.scale(0.6); di = domain(s, 1, sm, -1);  % dielectric coating domain
di.setrefractiveindex(1.5);
c = segment(60, [.5-.6i, .2 0 2*pi]);          % small circle segment
de = domain([], [], {s c}, {-1 -1});           % twice-punctured exterior domain
s.addinoutlayerpots('d'); s.addinoutlayerpots('s');
om = 20;                                       % incident wavenumber
di.addlayerpot(sm, [-1i*om 1]); de.addlayerpot(c, [-1i*om 1]);         % CFIEs
s.setmatch('diel', 'TM'); sm.setbc(1, 'D', []); c.setbc(1, 'D', []);   % BCs
o.nei = 2; o.buf = 1; o.M = 150; p = qpscatt(de, di, d, o);    % set up problem
\end{verbatim}
In addition, we now have a higher wavenumber, and
we choose an incident wave direction corresponding to
a Wood's anomaly \cite{linton07}. The solution is completed by,
\begin{verbatim}
p.setoverallwavenumber(om); p.setincidentwave(-acos(1-2*pi/om)); % Wood's anom
p.solvecoeffs; p.showfullfield(struct('ymax', 1.2));
\end{verbatim}
which produces Fig.~\ref{f:qpsc}b.
The numbers of quadrature nodes have been chosen to give 13 digits of
accuracy, giving ${\tt p.N}$ of 450 obstacle degrees of freedom
(751 total degrees of freedom including the quasi-periodizing scheme).
The solution time is 2 sec, the plotting time 7 sec.

For those interested in the solution method,
the Sommerfeld contour and poles for the Fourier-transform layer-potentials
can be visualized via {\tt p.showkyplane}; see \cite{qpsc}.
